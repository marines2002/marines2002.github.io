     <h3>Lanreath Football Club</h3> Another Local club is Lanreath (U8&#39;s) who have youth coaching will start again in September running for six week blocks each Sunday between 10.30 and 12 o'clock. We will in association 
     with Cornwall County Football Association be completing the schools club link in September. A coach from Lanreath will take coaching at the school for around four weeks after which any children interested can sign up to 
     attend further coaching at Lanreath. Duloe is one of the schools which we are hoping will agree to this schools club link. The coaching is undertaken by fully qualified coaches who are CRB Checked. The youth football coaching
     which we provide has recently been awarded its Charter standard. This is a significant award which gives confidence that the club has achieved high standards in its running and the coaching provided.
     The emphasis on our coaching is fun and enjoyment. We cater for principally 5-11 year old boys and girls of any ability. We are affiliated to the mini soccer centres which give an opportunity for some competitive mini soccer games.
